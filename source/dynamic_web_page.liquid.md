# Adding Dynamic Content to a Web Page With Ruby

## XP practices learned

* Test First Programing/Test Driven Development
* Incremental Design
* Incremental deployment
* Continuous Integration

## Tech skills learned

* [Dynamic Web Content](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_web_page){:target="_blank"} via [Erb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby){:target="_blank"}

This tutorial will lead you through the steps to dynamically generate content on a web
page using embedded Ruby, also know as erb. Dynamic content allows us to generate content for
a web page from things like databases to customize the user experience. 
Sites like Twitter, Facebook and Amazon make heavy use of dynamic content.

We will use Tracker stories to drive the functionality, some of which will be implemented in class.

## Getting started

* Fork and clone [https://github.com/gSchool/dynamic_restaurant_site](https://github.com/gSchool/dynamic_restaurant_site){:target="_blank"}
* Follow instructions in the [README](https://github.com/gSchool/dynamic_restaurant_site/blob/master/README.md){:target="_blank"}

Once the specs are running, you can start
making changes by importing the
stories found [here](http://students.gschool.it/trackerStories/dynamicRubyStories.csv){:target="_blank"}.
